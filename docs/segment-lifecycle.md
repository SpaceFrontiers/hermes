# Segment Lifecycle and Recovery

Status: design and operational contract, implemented; actualized 2026-07-24.

Hermes treats publication, replacement, cleanup, and deletion as one segment
ownership protocol. This document defines that protocol and the operator-facing
failure behavior. The central rule is simple:

> Every on-disk `seg_<id>.*` file set must have at least one lifecycle owner.
> Cleanup may delete an ID only after every owner is absent.

## Owners and transitions

| Owner            | Protects                                                                     | Released when                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| metadata         | A live, searchable segment in `metadata.json`                                | An atomic replacement generation is published                                    |
| active operation | Indexing output, merge/reorder sources, and its unpublished output           | Publication or the operation finishes; ordinary aborts retain it through cleanup |
| segment tracker  | Retired files still reachable by an existing reader, plus scheduled deletion | The last reader drops and deletion completes                                     |

The required transitions are:

```text
indexing: active(output) -> metadata + tracker -> release active

rewrite:  metadata(sources) + active(sources, output)
          -> metadata(output) + tracker(output, retired sources)
          -> release active -> delete sources after last reader

abort:    active(output) -> tracked deletion -> release active
panic:    active(output) -> release active + tracked idempotent cleanup/sweep
```

The next owner is installed before the previous owner is released. Merge and
reorder also claim all sources, which prevents overlapping rewrites of the same
segment. Newly generated outputs are claimed before their first file write, so
partial builders are protected from an orphan sweep too.

## Metadata is the commit point

Metadata mutations are serialized. A generation is written and fsynced as
`metadata.json.tmp`, then atomically renamed over `metadata.json`. The rename is
the logical commit point. The matching in-memory state and tracker transition
continues even if the requesting RPC is canceled; shutdown tracks and drains
that transaction.

A directory-fsync error after a successful rename is reported as degraded
crash durability, not as a rolled-back commit. Returning a pre-commit error at
that point would be unsafe: disk readers could already observe metadata that
references an output which an error path then deletes.

Indexing flush generations are all-or-nothing. The first worker build error or
panic marks the generation failed, the other workers drain their queues, every
successful sibling output is abandoned through the same tracked cleanup path,
and no partial generation is published. A timeout leaves the writer paused on
the same generation so a late worker cannot acknowledge the next commit by
mistake; the caller retries commit.

Once a prepared indexing commit starts, an owned finalizer—not the requesting
RPC—holds its segment guards. It completes metadata publication, refreshes the
primary-key view, and resumes workers in that order even if the request is
canceled. Ingestion receives explicit backpressure until the finalizer ends.
If publication fails before the atomic rename, the same prepared segments stay
owned and workers remain paused for a lossless retry; a new indexing generation
cannot be mixed into them. After the rename, optional cache-refresh failures
are fail-closed and cannot turn a durable commit into an apparent abort.

## Cancellation and shutdown

Tokio cannot cancel a `spawn_blocking` closure after it has started. Dropping or
aborting only its async wrapper while deleting an index would let filesystem
writes continue into a removed directory. Hermes therefore drains blocking
merge/reorder work instead of pretending to cancel it.

Process shutdown begins by closing lifecycle admission for every open index
before tonic drains its in-flight RPCs. The same cancellation flag is visible
inside BP refinement, merge copy loops, ANN reads, stores, and output writers;
those stages stop at bounded checkpoints and abandon unpublished outputs under
their existing operation guards. The optimizer supervisor joins all tasks it
already launched. Writers then wait for cancellation-safe commit finalizers,
signal and join native indexing workers, discard unpublished prepared
segments, and finally drain merge handles, lifecycle metadata tasks, and
deferred deletion ownership.

The log ordering is an operational invariant:

```text
Received SIGTERM, starting graceful shutdown...
[shutdown] gRPC server drained; waiting for background work
[shutdown] index '<name>' drained
Hermes server shut down gracefully
```

The first line acknowledges the signal; it does not claim that background work
has finished. The last line is emitted only after all registered work has
drained successfully. A deployment grace period must cover the longest bounded
cancellation stage; SIGKILL forfeits this contract.

Index deletion follows this order:

1. Acquire the per-index registry lease and create `.deleting`, serializing
   against open/create.
2. Stop accepting new lifecycle claims.
3. Drain search and writer handles already issued by the registry.
4. Signal and join indexing OS threads.
5. Drop unpublished prepared segments and cached readers/writer handles.
6. Drain merge/reorder operations, metadata transactions, and deferred deletes.
7. Remove the index directory.

The delete transaction is detached from the requesting RPC after the marker is
installed, so client cancellation does not abandon a live writer. If the
process exits during step 7, the `.deleting` marker causes the remaining
directory to be removed on the next server startup.

## Force-merge replacement lifecycle

Explicit force merge claims one final output group and all of its intermediate
output IDs before writing. This freezes that group's topology against
background merge/reorder races without claiming unrelated indexes. Inputs are
best-fit packed under `max_segment_docs`; groups with more than 64 sources use
a balanced 64-way reduction hierarchy. Intermediate reductions are streaming
block copies, while only the final reduction performs configured BP.

Each durable replacement immediately publishes metadata, refreshes the
writer's primary-key topology and the server's reader snapshot, and releases
retired sources when their last reader drops. Consequently, a large hierarchy
does not retain every source file until the final BP pass. The target writer
lock does pause indexing for that index while the foreground RPC runs. Other
indexes have independent writer locks, though their operations share global
merge/BP/resource limits.

## Orphans versus corruption

An orphan is a segment ID absent from metadata, active operations, and the
reader/deletion tracker. Exclusive writer open and the background optimizer may
sweep it. The sweep deletes every discovered path belonging to that ID,
including unknown legacy or partial suffixes, and safely ignores malformed
names. Read-only `Index::open` does not mutate the directory.

A missing file for a **metadata-live** segment is not an orphan. Normal cleanup
must never make the metadata internally consistent by silently dropping its
documents. Merge preflight validates every mandatory source file before costly
CPU work; deterministic missing/corrupt sources are quarantined for the process
lifetime and excluded from candidate selection. The entry remains visible for
diagnosis and explicit recovery.

Other merge failures back off exponentially from 30 seconds to 30 minutes and
schedule their own wakeup. A failed output is deleted only after rechecking
under the metadata lock that it was not published. This prevents both an
immediate retry/core-saturation loop and cleanup of an already committed output.
Standalone optimizer failures use the same exponential delay per source,
measured from pass completion; otherwise a pass longer than the scan interval
would restart almost immediately. Deterministic reorder corruption enters the
same process-lifetime quarantine as a corrupt merge source.

Reorder copies distinguish absent optional files from failures: only a genuine
`NotFound` for a file the source reader did not observe is skipped. Required
files, permission/storage errors, short copies, and invalid optional formats
fail the output. Before replacement publication, Hermes opens the complete
output segment and verifies its document count; metadata is never switched to
an output that only passed a shallow `.meta` check.

Budget-truncated BP is a successful lifecycle transition, not a failure retry.
Its replacement metadata carries `bp_unconverged_passes`; the optimizer admits
only lineages below `--optimizer-max-unconverged-passes`. Thus both failure
retries and successful deepening have explicit, finite scheduling bounds.

## Operator recovery

Repeated “quarantined metadata-live segment” or mandatory-file errors mean the
index already has a broken metadata reference. Preserve/copy the directory
before repair if the documents are not reproducible. Then stop normal traffic
and run the server once with:

```bash
hermes-server --data-dir /data --doctor
```

Doctor opens every metadata-live segment, removes entries that cannot be
validated, atomically saves the repaired metadata, and deletes their remaining
files. This is intentionally destructive and may reduce the document count; it
is not part of normal startup cleanup.

## Maintainer checklist

Any new segment-producing or deleting path must answer all of these:

- Is the output claimed before the first write?
- Does ownership survive success, error, cancellation, and panic?
- Is publication one durable metadata transaction with matching tracker state?
- Does abandoned-output cleanup recheck metadata before deletion?
- Are blocking tasks registered before shutdown can observe the task list empty?
- Does index deletion drain the task rather than only aborting its wrapper?
- Can the normal orphan sweep prove that metadata, active operations, and
  readers/deferred deletion no longer own the ID?
- Is a deterministic corrupt source quarantined while transient failures back
  off and wake themselves?
