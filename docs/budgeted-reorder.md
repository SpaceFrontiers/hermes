# Budgeted (Partial) BP Reordering

Status: design (2026-07-09), implemented.

## Problem

Full-depth BP on a large segment (18M+ docs ⇒ ~18 bisection levels × swap
passes over all postings) is hours of CPU, so big segments were reordered
rarely or never — exactly the segments where pruning quality matters most.

## Design: BP as an anytime algorithm

Stopping BP at any depth or deadline yields a valid permutation, and quality
is concave in work (top levels capture most of the log-gap gain). Because a
segment's layout _is_ the resume state, a follow-up pass warm-starts from the
previous order: early levels converge in ~0 swaps (the existing early-exit
fires) and the budget flows to deeper levels — repeated budgeted passes
converge to full-BP quality.

`BpBudget` (threaded through every reorder path):

- `min_partition_docs: Option<usize>` — depth cap; stop bisection at
  partitions of this size. **256 (= the default LSP superblock, 8 blocks ×
  32 vectors) reaches the hierarchy's coarse-pruning unit**; remaining
  levels only sharpen intra-superblock block ordering. The graph routine
  completes that chosen target normally; segment metadata deliberately
  records a depth-capped optimizer pass as `bp_converged = false` so the
  deepening ladder can later reach full block depth.
- `time_budget: Option<Duration>` — wall-clock deadline, checked between
  refinement passes and before each recursion (atomic flag across the rayon
  fan-out). Hitting it ends the pass cleanly with `converged = false`.

Per-segment metadata gains `bp_converged` (serde-default true for old
metadata) and `bp_unconverged_passes` (serde-default zero). What you cannot
budget away: each pass still rewrites the whole sparse
blob (the 4-bit grid is row-major — any permutation rewrites every row), so
partial reorder bounds CPU/memory, not per-pass IO. Passes go through the
cold-IO writer, so at least they no longer evict the cache.

## Optimizer tiering (hermes-server)

- Segments `< --optimizer-large-segment-docs` (default 5M): full-depth BP.
- Larger: budgeted pass — depth capped at
  `--optimizer-partial-min-partition-docs` (default 256) and wall-clock
  capped at `--optimizer-time-budget-secs` (default 600).
- Unconverged segments (deadline fired) are revisited alongside fresh work,
  with at most one deepening pass active globally. After it completes, the
  next pass waits `--optimizer-unconverged-cooldown-secs` (default 600).
  Starting cooldown at completion is important because a full sparse rewrite
  can outlast the BP deadline; starting it at launch caused the replacement
  segment to be requeued immediately.
- The optimizer deepens a replacement lineage only while its consecutive
  budget-exhausted rewrite count is below
  `--optimizer-max-unconverged-passes` (default 3, including its initial
  partial pass). The counter follows replacement IDs, includes a partial
  merge-time BP pass, and resets after convergence or a non-reordered merge.
  `0` disables optimizer follow-up deepening; it does not disable explicitly
  configured merge-time reorder.
- Merge-time reorder uses its own `--merge-bp-budget-secs` deadline. A
  truncated output joins the same paced deepening ladder.

Observability: `converged` in reorder logs, `bp_converged` in metadata, and
the Grafana superblock/block skip-ratio panels are the quality metric — a
partial pass shows up as high superblock skip ratio with a middling block
skip ratio that improves with each deepening pass.

## BP gain-ranking fix (found while testing)

The depth-cap regression test exposed a quality bug in the BP port: both
halves ranked docs by raw "gain of moving to the other side" and the top-mid
went left, so a misplaced left doc (wants right) and a misplaced right doc
(wants left) ranked identically and could never be exchanged. The reference
formulation negates the right half, producing one coherent
"belongs-right-ness" key; the partition takes the lowest-mid as the left
half. Fixed in `compute_gains` + the selection comparator; pinned by
`test_bp_depth_cap_separates_clusters_and_converges`. Expect measurably
better pruning from all reorders after this fix.

## Deepening ladder (2026-07-14)

Semantics change for aggressive continuous background reordering:

- A pass with a **depth floor above block granularity** (the optimizer's
  budgeted first pass on large segments, `min_partition_docs = 4096`) is now
  recorded `bp_converged = false` — by definition it has not reached
  block-level order. Previously it reported converged and large segments
  were permanently stuck at superblock-granularity order.
- **Merge-time BP is wall-clock-budgeted** (`--merge-bp-budget-secs`,
  default 600; `IndexConfig::merge_bp_time_budget`). A truncated merge pass
  still writes a valid, better-ordered segment, marked unconverged. This
  caps how long one merge holds a merge slot — previously a 64-source/18M-doc
  merge ran full-depth BP inline (10-30+ min per slot), which is how merge
  backlogs (350 segments at 30M docs) built up.
- The optimizer's **deepening is no longer starved by fresh segments**:
  under continuous ingestion fresh candidates arrive every commit, and the
  old "deepen only when idle" rule postponed deepening indefinitely. Now one
  unconverged segment is deepened per cooldown window
  (`--optimizer-unconverged-cooldown-secs`, default now 600, was 1800)
  alongside fresh work. Deepening passes run **full depth** with the wall
  clock budget — warm-starting makes already-ordered prefixes nearly free,
  so each pass pushes deeper until one beats the clock and converges.
  Only one deepening pass runs at a time, and its cooldown starts when the
  complete rewrite finishes (success, error, cancellation, or panic), not
  when it starts. This prevents long passes from continuously replacing and
  immediately requeueing their own unconverged output.

- **Merge fan-in default raised** (`TieredMergePolicy::large_scale()`
  `max_merge_at_once: 10 → 24`, baked in — no tuning flags): wide fan-in
  absorbs continuous-ingestion floods of small memtable segments in ~2.4×
  fewer merge passes. Giant merges are safe because output docs are capped
  by `max_merged_docs` and merge-time BP is wall-clock budgeted.

Net effect: merges are fast and bounded; order quality converges in the
background via warm-started passes; `bp_converged` now means
"block-granularity order reached".

## Single-pass parallelism (2026-07-14)

A single reorder pass has three phases; all three are now parallel and all
three run on one process-wide, bounded background pool. In `hermes-server`,
`--optimizer-threads` sets its width when the periodic optimizer is enabled;
otherwise merge-time and manual BP share the `cores/2` fallback pool. There is
never a pool per index or per pass, and background CPU stays off the global
query pool:

1. **Forward-index build** (was fully serial). Real doc ids are assigned in
   ascending vid order, so each BMP block owns a contiguous real-id range —
   df counting uses one dense atomic vocabulary table shared by the bounded
   pool, and the CSR count/fill phases write disjoint per-block slices (safe
   `split_at_mut` carving, no locks). This avoids one vocabulary-sized hash map
   per worker. Candidate discovery retains only a budgeted low-frequency set.
2. **Graph bisection** (already parallel: `rayon::join` halves + parallel
   gain passes, wall-clock budgeted).
3. **Permuted blob write** (was fully serial). Output blocks encode
   independently; they are encoded in parallel in memory-derived windows and
   written serially in blob order. Grid spill and encoded-window budgets share
   the remaining per-pass allowance after persistent document maps.

Measured (300k docs / 14.4M postings, RamDirectory, aarch64, release):
forward index 135 ms → 50 ms (2.7×); blob-encode phase ~3.3 s → ~1.0 s;
`writer.reorder()` end-to-end 4.7 s → 2.36 s (2.0×). BP itself (1.3 s
full-depth here) is now the dominant phase, and it is budgeted/warm-started.
Evidence: `bench_forward_index_build` (`#[ignore]`) in
`hermes-core/src/index/tests/bmp.rs`.

## Default changes (2026-07-14, follow-up)

- `IndexConfig::default()` now uses `TieredMergePolicy::large_scale()` (the
  server already did). Tier floors only shape _when_ segments merge, and
  merge-time BP is wall-clock budgeted, so the policy is safe at any scale.
- `bp_memory_budget_bytes` default 2 GB → 24 GB (`--bp-memory-budget-mb`
  default 24576). It is a cap, not an allocation — memory use is proportional
  to the segment actually being reordered (~4 B/posting + ~32 B/doc). Sized
  from prod evidence: a 58M-doc / 5B-posting pass estimated 20.1 GB; smaller
  budgets trimmed it by dropping highest-df dims (2 GB dropped ~10% of
  eligible dims on 18M-doc merges).

## Process-level resource bounds (2026-07-15)

Thread width and operation concurrency are intentionally independent:

- `--optimizer-threads` controls CPU parallelism inside the shared pool. A
  running BP pass is expected to keep up to that many cores busy.
- `--optimizer-concurrent-passes` (default 2) gates complete reorder passes
  across every index and every entry point: optimizer, merge-time, and manual.
  Concurrent passes share the CPU pool, but each may consume its own forward
  index budget and rewrite buffers.
- `--bp-memory-budget-mb` is therefore a **per-pass algorithmic working-set
  bound**. It covers record maps, forward CSR, candidate/remap storage,
  vocabulary degree arrays (including parallel recursion), and rewrite
  grid/encode windows. It does not include source/output mmap pages, directory
  implementation buffers, unrelated merge structures, or indexing. A
  conservative process estimate starts with `concurrent passes × memory
budget`, then adds those external consumers.

When the dense vocabulary table itself cannot fit, the pass emits identity or
block order and remains explicitly unconverged. Recursion parallelism is
reduced to the number of vocabulary-sized degree arrays that fit. Memory
pressure can therefore reduce reorder quality or parallelism, but cannot be
misreported as convergence and trigger an unbounded immediate loop.

The gate is acquired before expensive forward-index construction. Scheduler
permits are nonblocking, indexes are visited with a rotating start point, fresh
segments are ordered small-first, and at most one unconverged candidate is
selected first. This prevents a quiet index or repeated deepening candidate
from monopolizing capacity.
