# Whole-term regex queries and escaped literals

## Implementation

Public search enters the query-language parser or a typed `RegexQuery`, then
uses the segment reader's existing bounded dictionary matching and term-union
scorer. The benchmark HTTP adapter translates its declared `regex` family into
that core type. Native sync, native async and WASM share compilation and union
execution. No schema, posting, protocol or persisted format changes are needed.

The result invariant is the deduplicated union of documents containing matching
whole terms, each with constant score 1.0. Patterns are case-sensitive and are
not analyzed or lowercased: changing regex source text can change its language.
Matching uses Unicode scalar values. The supported regular-expression subset
includes literals, character classes/ranges, grouping, alternation, `.`, `?`,
`*`, `+` and bounded repetition. It covers all 13 Searchbench regex expressions.
Extended Lucene operators, lookaround, backreferences, inline flags and shorthand
escape classes are rejected explicitly. Escapes quote literal punctuation.

Regex and wildcard share the existing dictionary/union execution owner. Regex and wildcard restrict scans to proven literal-prefix ranges;
patterns without a finite nonempty prefix set scan the field vocabulary. Compilation is limited to 1,024 pattern bytes and 2 MiB for the
compiled expression and DFA cache. The existing per-segment limits remain:
1,000,000 examined terms, 1,024 matched terms and 5,000,000 postings. Exhaustion
returns an error rather than partial results. Work is bounded dictionary
matching plus the existing posting union; this does not establish full-corpus
support for broad expressions. Chunked-field rejection and RGB ID translation
remain shared with existing expanded-term queries.

### Bounded prefix extraction

The implementation uses the regex parser's proven literal-prefix set
to restrict dictionary access. Extraction retains at most 64 literals of 64
bytes, collapses covered ranges, and falls back to the entire field when the
prefix set is infinite or includes the empty prefix. The original expression
still confirms every term. Alternation and optional literals must never drop
matches. Scan, matched-term and posting budgets apply to the union of all
ranges, not independently to each range. No dictionary or posting format
changes, auxiliary index, cache, or raised default limit are involved.

Expose explicit syntax `field:regex("pattern")`, with JSON string escaping.
Bare regex operators are not reinterpreted as regex queries. Ordinary term
syntax additionally accepts dots, apostrophes and backslash-escaped literals.
Unescape once in the parser, then use the field's existing tokenizer; a colon
escaped in a term must not become a field separator, nor may escaped wildcard
operators become patterns. Boolean modifiers and explicit fields retain their
current meaning. Analyzer compatibility is separate from accepting syntax.

## Validation

Regression tests first reproduced rejected regex and punctuated expressions through
public query parsing/search. Tests verify exact IDs/counts, whole-term anchoring,
Unicode, duplicate matching terms, no-match cases, bounded expansion errors,
malformed/unsupported syntax, Boolean composition, RGB mapping, and native/async
agreement. The WASM search API exercises regex and escaped terms. The probe submits all
826 expressions to the real HTTP adapter on the same capability fixture; this
measures acceptance, not 10M-corpus count or ranking parity. Search harness and portable build outcomes are recorded in the performance review.

The [HTTP capability probe](benchmark-results/query-support-2026-09-24/README.md)
now accepts **826/826 expressions**, compared with 801/826 before. All 801
previously accepted responses remain identical on the unchanged four-document
fixture. This is capability evidence only; the performance comparison remains
the original 15-query subset until full-corpus semantic agreement is established.
