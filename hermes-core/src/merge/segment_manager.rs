//! Segment manager — coordinates segment commit, background merging, and trained structures.
//!
//! Architecture:
//! - **Single mutation queue**: All metadata mutations serialize through `tokio::sync::Mutex<ManagerState>`.
//! - **Active-operation ownership**: Every segment that is being built, merged,
//!   or reordered is registered before its first file is written and remains
//!   registered until it is either published in metadata or abandoned.
//! - **Concurrent merges**: Multiple non-overlapping merges can run in parallel.
//!   New merges are rejected only if they share segments with an active operation.
//! - **Auto-trigger**: Each completed merge re-evaluates the merge policy and spawns
//!   new merges if eligible (cascading merges for higher tiers).
//! - **ArcSwap for trained**: Lock-free reads of trained vector structures.
//!
//! # Segment lifecycle invariant
//!
//! Every on-disk `seg_*` ID must be protected by at least one of these owners:
//!
//! 1. `state.metadata` while the segment is live and searchable;
//! 2. `active_operations` while an indexing/merge/reorder task owns it; or
//! 3. `tracker` while a retired segment is still visible to a reader or its
//!    filesystem deletion is scheduled.
//!
//! An ID with no owner is an orphan and may be swept. Transitions are ordered
//! so the new owner is installed before the old owner is released.
//!
//! # Locking model (deadlock-free by construction)
//!
//! ```text
//! Lock ordering (acquire in this order):
//!   1. state               — tokio::sync::Mutex, held for mutations + disk I/O
//!   2. active_operations   — parking_lot::Mutex (sync), sub-μs hold, RAII guard
//!   3. tracker.inner       — parking_lot::Mutex (sync), sub-μs hold
//!
//! Independent bookkeeping (never held with `state`):
//!   trained                — arc_swap::ArcSwapOption, lock-free
//!   vector_artifact_update — atomic producer gate, held across manual training
//!   merge_handles          — parking_lot::Mutex, synchronous short hold
//!   lifecycle_handles      — parking_lot::Mutex, synchronous short hold
//!   merge/reorder permits  — tokio semaphores shared by configuration
//! ```
//!
//! **Rule:** Never hold a sync lock while `.await`-ing.
